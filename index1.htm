      <H1>What is an Online Learning Platform?</H1>
      <h3>An online learning platform is an information system that provides a safe learning environment where students can take online courses.</H3>
        <H3>Such online learning platforms are often called ‘online course marketplaces’ because they give learners the opportunity to search for and pay for online courses directly.</H3>
        <H3>While some of these course marketplaces are used to feature online courses, the majority are more educational-based and strictly offer university-level education.</H3>
        <H3>The two titles are often used interchangeably, and the real differences come from the person using the definition and the context of the conversation. From a student’s perspective, a learning platform is a place to find educational content, search and buy courses or whole educational programs. Whereas, from an educator’s perspective, it is the place to deliver knowledge.</H3>
    
        <h1>What is an Online Course Platform in Relation to a Learning Management System?</h1>
      <H3>An online course platform is a type of learning management system (LMS) that online instructors can use to create, host, deliver and sell online courses.</H3>
      <H3>An LMS is the higher category usually used by enterprises for employee training, customer education, and onboarding or by academic institutions to support teaching. However, the whole category can sometimes include course platforms or even WordPress plugins being used by SMEs to create and sell online courses.</H3>
      <H3>Unlike online learning platforms, online course platforms are cloud-hosted software that allows instructors to create online classes or individual lessons by uploading educational material that they have created using text, images, video, PDF files, and audio.</H3>
      <H3>In essence, individuals or SMEs can use a course platform to create their own course marketplace instead of offering their courses in a popular courses marketplace like Udemy, Edx, MagnetBrains, or Skillshare. This way, they can keep all the revenue and user data that they otherwise would have no control over.</H3>
        
      <H1>Online Learning Platforms VS Online Course Platforms</H1>
      <H3>An online learning platform emphasizes and presents the learner’s perspective whereas an online course platform takes the perspective of the online instructor/ teacher.</H3>
      <H3>Online learning platforms are often used to identify marketplaces for courses or education, like Coursera, Udemy, and LinkedIn Learning–formerly known as Lynda, while course platforms usually refer to the software used to create a learning environment, such as LearnWorlds, Thinkific, Kajabi, or Teachable.</H3>
      <H3>Using an online learning platform takes off a lot of the hard work of building an audience, marketing, and sales, but you may not have control over pricing, user data, and branding.</H3>
      <H3>With an online course platform, you have greater flexibility and freedom in managing your learning resources and course materials. Also, you get to have a say in the design and look of the entire website that hosts your online courses and in regards to the course itself – how it is being presented and promoted.</H3>
      <h3>Which platform you are going to choose essentially comes down to your business’s needs.</h3>
